# RandomWalk.c
Random Walk program in C

This program is a game where an insect must escape a 
spider's web by randomly hopping around the net until it is free!
If the spider gets to the insect named "Flavia" before the 
number of turns is up then Flavia is eaten :(
If Flavia can escape by randomly hopping her way out before
the number of turns entered by the user are up, then Flavia is free! :)
